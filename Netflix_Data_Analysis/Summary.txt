Objective:

- Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix movie/show data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about content distribution, popularity,          and user ratings.

- Answer key business or analytical questions: What genres are most common? Which titles are most/least popular? How do ratings distribute?

Dataset:

- A dataset of Netflix titles (movies & TV shows) containing columns like: genre, vote average, popularity, release date, title, etc.

- Cleaned and preprocessed using Python (Pandas) to make it analysis-ready.

Key Steps:

1. Data Cleaning

- Handle missing or malformed values

- Convert date columns to datetime type

- Clean up genre, vote, and popularity fields

2. Feature Engineering

- Create categorical bins for Vote_Average (e.g., “not popular”, “average”, “popular”)

- Derive new date-related features (year, month, maybe weekday) if needed

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Genre Distribution: Count of titles by genre (bar charts)

- Vote Average Distribution: How many titles fall into each rating category

- Popularity Analysis: Identify which movies/shows have the highest and lowest popularity

- Time Trends (if applicable): Show trends of added content over date / time

4. Visualization

- Use Seaborn/matplotlib to create bar charts, count plots, and maybe line graphs

- Possibly use heatmaps or scatter plots, depending on the data

5. Insights & Findings

- The most frequent genre is Drama

- Most titles fall into the average vote rating category

- The most “popular” movie or show and what genre it belongs to

- The least popular title and its genre

6. Conclusion / Recommendations

- Netflix could focus on producing more content in genres that are both frequent and popular.

- Titles with lower Vote_Average but high popularity might indicate commercial success over critical acclaim.

- If trends over time are shown, maybe recommend optimal times for content release.
