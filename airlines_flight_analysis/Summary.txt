# ✈️ Airline Flights Data Analysis

## 🧭 Project Overview  
This project explores airline flight data to uncover patterns and insights related to **flight delays, cancellations, and airline performance**.  
It is based on a YouTube tutorial that demonstrates how to perform real-world data analysis using **Python** and **Pandas**.

The project helps develop practical data-analysis skills, including **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization**.

## 🎯 Objective  
- To analyze flight delay data and identify major causes of delays and cancellations.  
- To determine which airlines perform better in terms of on-time flights.  
- To visualize trends such as delays by airline, month, and time of day.  
- To practice data analysis workflows using Python.

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle – Airline Flight Delay Dataset (or similar public dataset)  
- **Format:** CSV file  
- **Size:** ~5 million rows and multiple columns (depending on dataset version)  
- **Key Features:**
  - `Date` – Flight date  
  - `Airline` – Airline carrier name/code  
  - `Origin` & `Destination` – Airport codes  
  - `Departure Delay` – Delay in minutes  
  - `Arrival Delay` – Delay in minutes  
  - `Cancelled` – Flight cancellation indicator  
  - `Distance` – Distance between airports

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Google Colab** – For executing the analysis

## 🔍 Project Workflow  

### 1. Data Loading and Inspection  
- Loaded CSV data using Pandas.  
- Checked the shape, columns, and data types.  
- Identified missing and duplicate values.

### 2. Data Cleaning  
- Removed null or irrelevant rows.  
- Converted date columns to `datetime` format.  
- Created new features like `Month`, `Day of Week`, and `Hour`.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Performed visual and statistical analysis to explore:  
- Flight counts by **Airline**, **Month**, and **Day of Week**.  
- Average **departure and arrival delays** per airline.  
- Correlation between **distance** and **delay time**.  
- Total number of **cancelled flights** by airline.  
- Time-based patterns of delays (hourly trends).

### 4. Visualization  
- Bar charts for delay counts per airline.  
- Heatmaps for correlation between numeric columns.  
- Line plots for delay trends by month.  
- Pie charts for cancellation distribution.

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Certain airlines consistently had higher average delays.  
- Delay frequency increased during **holiday months** and **winter seasons**.  
- **Short-haul flights** showed more frequent delays than long-haul flights.  
- Cancellation rates were higher at **specific airports** or times of the year.  
- A mild correlation existed between **flight distance** and **delay time**.

## ✅ Conclusion  
The analysis revealed valuable insights into airline performance and delay patterns.  
Such insights can help:
- Airlines optimize scheduling and resource management.  
- Passengers plan flights with better reliability.  
- Data analysts understand real-world EDA processes.

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Build a **machine learning model** to predict flight delays.  
- Include **weather data** or **air traffic volume** for deeper analysis.  
- Develop an **interactive dashboard** using Streamlit or Power BI.
